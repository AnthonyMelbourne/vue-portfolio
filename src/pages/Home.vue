            Deathcore upstarts <span>BABIRUSA</span> have made quite the name
            for themselves in their short existence, positioning themselves as
            forerunners for the deathcore crown in Australian heavy music. After
            releasing their first single in mid-2019 and subsequent singles in
            early-2020, they gained themselves quite a lot of hype, especially
            considering that the band is made up with current and ex-members of
            local favourites <span>Tomb of Doom</span>,
            <span>I, Valiance</span>, <span>A Night in Texas</span>,
            <span>The Senate</span> and <span>Crowned in Flesh</span>, so
            understandably there would be a certain amount of expectation that
            whatever comes out of these guys is going to be undeniably brutal
            and heavy. <br /><br />
            Their sound is very easily categorized as technical deathcore along
            the lines of
            <span>Aversions Crown</span> and <span>Shadow of Intent</span>, with
            strong elements of technical and progressive death metal intertwined
            with swathes of melodic death and traditional deathcore with a hint
            of slam – transitioning from sweep picked arpeggios, palm muted
            chugs and slams to blast beats and lightning fast drum fills with
            ease – with an emphasis on crafting intricate, thoughtful and catchy
            riffs and let’s not forget the use of two vocalists. <br /><br />
            <img

            />
            For some reason duel vocal deathcore, or extreme metal in general
            has been very few and far between – genre luminaries
            <span>Despised Icon</span> as well as newer bands such as
            <span>AngelMaker</span>, have proved that it could be done and done
            well, for whatever reason the trend just never took, but
            <span>BABIRUSA</span> clearly never got that memo – going from
            shrill black metal highs to deathcore signature mid-range vocal
            style to brutal death’s guttural lows, all while exhibiting a song
            writing and production quality that is at an international level,
            one would not expect any less from the very capable hands of
            <span>Sean Delander (Thy Art Is Murder)</span> and
            <span>Dan Field</span> at the helm, handling production and
            engineering duties respectively. <br /><br />
            You can’t talk about this album without mentioning its concept – Man
            vs Machine – Not necessarily a original concept by any means but one
            that is still incredibly relevant in this day and age, a concept
            that has transcended generations and all form of media, through
            books (Dune, The Humanoids, Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?
            etc.), film (The Matrix and Terminator franchises, Blade Runner
            etc.), television (Black Mirror etc.) and music (Fear Factory etc.)

            The first track titled ‘343’ – is a human who is pulled into a
            cybernetic world by artificial intelligence. Opening with clean
            guitars and bass with a harmonized lead that builds behind a sample
            (or a soliloquy?) that asks itself questions of purpose and it’s
            perceived memories, all while the music grows in intensity until it
            coalesces and breaks, fading out and unfurling the first single and
            second track, ‘DESOLATION SYSTEM’, starting off with a quick drum
            fill and a chugging riff, the two front-men use their extensive
            range to bounce off of one another, sharing similarities in their
            individual style yet, playing to their strengths and layering for
            full effect. But while the vocalists get to show off, drummer Rangi
            Barnes is in the back, effortlessly keeping the pace and groove
            while guitarists Tate Senhenn and Dean White seem to do laps of the
            fret-board culminating in a huge breakdown.
            <br /><br />
            Track three, ‘HUMANOID’, continues the narrative with the assistance
            of another sample, further deepening the dilemma our protagonist is
            engulfed in, while still contemplating whether or not it is in fact
            alive, or if it even matters at all. The sample concludes with
            chaotic, spiralling guitars that sound like what I imagine
            trepanning without anaesthesia feels like, before launching into an
            almost djent/groove chug part, transitioning into tech death
            frenetic fret-board wizardry that would make
            <span>Necrophagist</span> blush, while Rheese and Kyle continue
            eviscerate their vocal chords, before breaking into a guitar solo
            and melodic death-esque riff section that gives me a fair amount of
            The Black Dahlia Murder vibes, which I really enjoy, a welcome
            injection of melody in the almost anxiety inducing riffage returns
            before the massive breakdown, building up and gaining momentum,
            culminating in a guitar solo and sinister tremolo riff and blast
            beat section that eventually fades into oblivion. <br /><br />
            ‘CATATONIA’, the third single begins with both vocalists proclaiming
            “We are the only ones who see the world for what it is!” before the
            rest of the band joins in, luring the listener into a false sense of
            security before changing the tempo from a mid-paced groove section
            to lightning fast tech death, slowing down just enough for a slow,
            menacing build up allowing you catch your breath and to believe for
            a second that a breakdown was coming but instead, speeding up even
            faster than before, until completely slowing down for an epic guitar
            solo and an almost discordant black metal tremolo riff section,
            closing out the track with a sample; the continuation of the story
            leading into ‘REFLECTION’, a short instrumental giving us further
            insight into the story of ‘343’.

            ></iframe>
            Segueing on from track 5 – ‘PENDULUM SWING’, ominous clean guitar
            strums behind a sample telling the main character, “It’s time to
            become a part of all things…”, launching into a very catchy groove
            orientated and bouncy djent chug riff that is sure to get the crowd
            moving – then putting the foot on the gas with a chaotic riff
            section that winds and swirls, stopping and starting on a whim,
            maintaining the groove until crowning with an earth shattering
            breakdown.
            <br /><br />
            ‘RESISTOR’ wastes no time, getting right to business, with an
            astonishingly fast and elaborate riff that would feel right at home
            on a <span>Deeds of Flesh</span> or
            <span>Decrepit Birth</span> record, which is just fantastic, Tate
            and Dean shine especially bright here, the riffs are complex and
            have a neo-classical quality to them, especially with the quiet
            choir effect behind them – an accompanying chug part with the
            appropriate amount of guitar bends for full effect before breaking
            into a quick jazz interlude that merely stalls long enough to
            demolish you with an absolutely crushing breakdown, fading out and
            into ‘ABOMINATION’, the second single maintains a mid-paced tempo
            and bouncy feel for that keeps up the intensity and groove, while
            the vocalists execute rapid fire vocal attacks back and forth,
            Rangi’s drumming is particularly impressive here. <br /><br />
            ‘DEHUMANIZED POPULACE’ grinds along with vicious chugs, harmonized
            shrill high pitched screams and Gutturals, eviscerating your senses
            with a homage to tech death that would make
            <span>Chuck Schuldiner</span> proud, until the Breakdown hits you
            like a truck, this one is sure to be a crowd favourite, while
            ‘ZEROHOUR’, the final outro track, laden with samples and epic
            guitar harmonies concluding our protagonist, ‘343’s fateful journey
            of self-discovery and alienation. <br /><br />
            Overall, this is a phenomenal debut album – ultimately a bold choice
            to do a concept record for your first, but given the experience in
            song writing that the various members possess, it’s not surprising
            that they pulled it off in spades.
            <br /><br />

            Bizarre encounters … Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter in their third
            film journey. Not excellent maybe, but by no means bogus either,
            this cheerful Bill and Ted threequel brings the story of our two
            laidback heroes up to the melancholy autumn of their middle age.

            Alex Winter is Bill – and he’s eerily the same – and Keanu Reeves is
            Ted; though with that dark mop of hair framing his now rather
            Easter-Island-stern face, Ted looks more forbidding to me, as if
            carrying the baggage of Neo (from Matrix) and hitman John Wick. But
            with his weirdly lovable awkward gestures, Ted clearly still has no
            idea how or why to move his arms. Like the other two films, this is
            written by Chris Matheson and Ed Solomon, and the director is Dean
            Parisot, renowned for the sci-fi comedy classic Galaxy Quest.
            <br /><br />
            Bill and Ted was always the non-stoner stoner franchise, a comedy
            high only on its own absurdity and sweetly serious idealism: as
            ever, it reminds me (in the best possible way) of a kids’ TV show by
            someone like Bob “Rentaghost” Block – something to put alongside
            Doctor Who and Wayne’s World. George Carlin, who played the boys’
            cosmic time-travel guide Rufus in the first two films, died in 2008,
            and makes a virtual-reality appearance here courtesy of archive
            footage; Kristen Schaal plays his daughter, Kelly.
            <br /><br />

              class="feature-two-promo"
            />
            Nowadays, Bill and Ted are getting on in years, and their band, Wyld
            Stallyns, has suffered a cataclysmic loss of popularity. The apples
            of the men’s respective eyes are their music-mad twentysomething
            daughters, each of whom has effectively been given the name of their
            dad’s best friend: Thea (Samara Weaving) and Billie (Brigette
            Lundy-Paine). This crossover further seals their friends-for-life
            dedication. Each young woman is of course weirdly similar to her old
            man, a single-joke mannerism that restricts these performers a fair
            bit.
            <br /><br />
            The terrible crisis arrives when Bill and Ted are summoned into the
            distant future by Kelly, and informed by the universe’s Great Leader
            (an amusingly imperious Holland Taylor) that they have to compose a
            great track to bring the world together and prevent the destruction
            of space and time. The boys, sublimely confident that they can do
            it, but unwilling to go through the faff of actually doing it,
            simply decide to time-travel forward to the point when it has been
            done and snatch the composition from their future selves. As Bill
            declares to Ted: “You have had many counterintuitive ideas over the
            years, but this is the counterintuitivest of all.” But the Great
            Leader has an alternative plan to save the world, simply to kill
            Bill and Ted, for which she has trained a neurotic robot assassin
            called Dennis, channelling Douglas Adams’s Marvin the Paranoid
            Android — a nice turn from Anthony Carrigan.

            wacky adventures and bizarre encounters with their own variously
            transformed selves run in parallel with the attempts of Thea and
            Billie to assemble their own universe-saving supergroup on their
            dads’ behalf. They travel back to the 1960s and recruit Jimi Hendrix
            (DazMann Still), to the 1920s to pick up Louis Armstrong (Jeremiah
            Craft) and then to 18th-century Salzburg to enlist Mozart (Daniel
            Dorr). The choice of classical musician here is surely a missed
            opportunity: Hendrix was renowned for living next door to the London
            house once occupied by GF Handel and, asked by a newspaper about it,
            he famously replied: “To tell you the God’s honest truth I haven’t
            heard much of the fella’s stuff. But I dig a bit of Bach now and
            again.” But of course the most powerful musician of all is the Grim
            Reaper from Bergman’s Seventh Seal, first encountered in Bill and
            Ted’s Bogus Journey — funny stuff from William Sadler.
            <br /><br />
            It’s amiably amusing, and Bill and Ted’s Peter Pannish inability to
            accept the ageing process is enjoyably surreal, with a weird tinge
            of not-entirely-intentional tragedy. The failure to give Weaving and
            Lundy-Paine anything really funny to do is a problem; but all the
            cast are likable, and it’s a sweet-natured journey backwards and
            forwards down memory lane.

              >I have mixed feelings about Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, and
              frankly I’m not at all happy with how Activision has handled the
              transition from Modern Warfare to Black Ops Cold War in terms of
              the two games’ integration into Warzone.</span
            >
            <br /><br />
            I’ve waited some time to write this review, simply because you
            really can’t judge a game like Call Of Duty based on how it plays on
            launch week. Historically, Activision has waited several weeks after
            the latest entry’s release to populate its micro-transaction shop.
            Reviewing a game before micro-transactions are live is a precarious
            proposition. But now much has changed. Starting with Modern
            Warfare in 2019, not only were map packs removed as DLC and replaced
            with free maps and a seasonal battle pass, the games dispensed with
            loot boxes entirely and adopted an Item Shop similar
            to Fortnite, selling only cosmetics and weapon blueprints (which, to
            be fair, are questionably pay-to-win in nature).
            <br /><br />
            Still, how do you review a game that hasn’t even launched its first
            season, that hasn’t fully integrated into the free-to-play Battle
            Royale mode, Warzone yet? You can’t, I’d argue. It’s not the
            complete game yet. In this review I’ll discuss the Cold
            War campaign, multiplayer, integration into Warzone and Season 1
            content as a barometer for future seasonal content. I will not
            discuss Zombies mode as I don’t really play that mode and don’t feel
            comfortable reviewing it. I’ve never enjoyed Zombies modes in the
            past and I don’t expect that to change now. In interest of fairness,
            I will leave that aside.
            <br /><br />
            Of further note, I’ve played this game on both PC and PS5 (I
            received a PC review code but purchased the PS5 version of the
            game). It runs great—with some caveats—on both PC and console.
            Graphically, the PC version is superior but not enough to truly
            matter to anyone but the most graphics-obsessed gamers. Frankly,
            while I’m in the middle of a gunfight I don’t have a ton of time to
            pay attention to graphics. That being said, there’s no doubt that a
            good gaming PC running modern hardware (I have an RTX 3080 in mine)
            makes for a much richer campaign experience. Ray-tracing, DLSS, and
            all the other bells and whistles really do add to the experience. In
            any case, we’ll start with …

            <span>The Campaign</span><br />
            I really enjoyed the Call Of Duty: Black Ops Cold War campaign. This
            I can say without equivocation. It’s a solid, exciting campaign with
            some interesting twists and turns, a trippy ending(s) and some cool
            puzzles to solve. The game takes place in the 1980s. You play as a
            couple different characters depending on the mission, but primarily
            you’re a character whose gender, backstory and so forth you create
            yourself. And it turns out you’re quite the enigma. I won’t spoil
            the details. Suffice to say, nothing is as it seems. The final act
            is Black Ops at its weirdest and most inventive. The campaign’s
            story focuses largely on your boss, Russell Adler, and his pursuit
            of Soviet spy Perseus. Familiar faces like Frank Woods and Alex
            Mason return to the fold, and you’ll play some missions as Mason
            though these are side-missions. The campaign isn’t long, but you’ll
            likely have to play some missions more than once to gather evidence
            which is used in a pair of puzzles that are required to complete in
            order to complete the side missions the correct way. These puzzles
            are actually quite good, and can’t simply be looked up online to
            solve. To get a sense of these puzzles, check out my guides

              class="feature-two-promo"
            />
            Suffice to say, I absolutely loved solving these and their addition
            to the campaign makes it that much better. These aren’t simply
            puzzles like you might find in an Uncharted game, either. They
            really make you think. Hopefully we see much more of this in future
            Call Of Duty games. The campaign isn’t long. Maybe 7 or 8 hours
            depending on your skill level, how much time you spend searching for
            evidence and exploring and the difficulty setting you select. Par
            for the course when it comes to this franchise, which is fine by me.
            So many games are so long. I enjoy getting through a campaign in
            just a few sittings. Is the campaign as good as Modern
            Warfare 2019’s? I think so, actually. I rank them fairly
            neck-and-neck. It even includes at least one crossover character
            from the Modern Warfare universe, as these two franchises grow ever
            closer.

            <span>Multiplayer</span><br />
            Where the two games—Modern Warfare and Cold War—wildly diverge is in
            multiplayer. They are simply nothing alike, for better or worse.
            There will be those who prefer Cold War over Modern Warfare and vice
            versa, and far be it from me to say one is objectively better than
            the other. But I do prefer Modern Warfare overall for a variety of
            reasons. The pros and cons of both games below.
            <br /><br />
            <span
              >-Gunplay is better in Modern Warfare. The sound effects of guns
              being fired, the oomph you feel when they’re fired, all contribute
              to a more satisfying gunplay experience. In a game largely about
              running around and shooting other players, this is paramount. Cold
              War, even after some improvements, still feels floaty and its guns
              sound tinny by comparison. <br /><br />
              -Graphically, Modern Warfare’s multiplayer is leaps and bounds
              better than Cold War. The latter is more colorful, which is nice,
              but its aging engine shows.
              <br /><br />
              -One can debate other points. Cold War doesn’t have gun mounting,
              which may lead to less camping. I don’t have a preference. You
              can’t open or burst through doors in Cold War either. That’s
              neither here nor there as far as I’m concerned.
              <br /><br />
              -I really like Cold War’s soundtrack, which includes some fun
              synth tracks. I also like that we have map voting again.
              <br /><br />
              -Map design is hit and miss across both games. I wish I could make
              a playlist out of both games’ best maps, but Activision has
              divided its live-service Call Of Duty franchise into separate
              entries each year instead of just one game, ever-evolving, with
              new campaigns and multiplayer options a la Destiny 2.
              <br /><br />
              <img
                src="./assets/images/games/promo/Call-of-duty-cold-war-promo3.jpg"
                alt="CALL OF DUTY - Black Ops : Cold War promo photo"
                class="feature-two-promo"
              />
              -Split-screen is a major issue in Black Ops games in general, and
              is absolute garbage once again in Cold War. It’s honestly become
              somewhat insulting at this point to all Call Of Duty gamers who
              enjoy playing couch co-op or modes like the excellent 2v2 Gunfight
              locally.
              <br /><br />
              -Adding to that post, something I hadn’t realised at the time, is
              that split-screen is actually much worse than I at first realised.
              I was playing Gunfight with my kids the other day in split-screen
              and we realised that there’s a pretty atrocious bug. This bug
              allows the second player to see the red silhouettes of the other
              team’s players no matter where they are on the map instead of just
              at the beginning of the match. So you can see where your opponents
              are headed, line up your shot and win easily even against much
              better players. Not exactly fair. Not something that should be in
              a finished product of a video game.
              <br /><br />
              -I despise how points are handed out in Objective-based modes. I
              can be the only player who stands on the hardpoint for the
              entirety of a match, getting nearly every point for my team, and
              still come in last place on the leaderboard simply because the act
              of playing the objective leads to fewer kills. It’s ridiculous,
              and Treyarch has every ability to adjust this to make it more fair
              and to encourage people to actually play the objective in these
              modes. Which many do not, since far too many Call Of Duty players
              think Team Deathmatch is the only mode that counts.
              <br /><br />
              -I do like that Cold War is a faster, more arcadey entry in the
              series. I suppose this is where a Destiny 2 style approach might
              suffer (though if Activision continues to tie each entry
              to Warzone this actually makes it kind of weird—more on that in a
              second). In any case, Cold War feels much less like a military-sim
              game and much more like a video game, if that makes sense. It’s
              speedier and less realistic, even without double-sprint. This can
              be fun. In some ways, the floatier gunplay works with this
              movement style, and in the end much of it will come down to taste.
              <br /><br />
              -What to say about Skill-Based Matchmaking? This is the Hot Topic
              on many gaming forums. I find it to be a non-issue in Call Of
              Duty. Many players seem to simply regurgitate what their favorite
              streamers say, but I’ve found that most matchmaking seems just
              fine. Sometimes I’m outmatched, but most of the time I find I’m in
              the upper half of the leaderboard—sometimes in the number one
              spot; other times dead last. I can’t attribute that entirely to
              matchmaking, however, since sometimes I have off days or crappy
              matches and sometimes I’m on fire.
              <br /><br />
              -Here’s a fun story. I was playing Fortnite with my ten-year-old
              recently and we suddenly started getting into much more
              challenging matches, with players obviously far better than we
              were used to. I realised that this was probably SBMM kicking in
              since we’d been winning so much. Now we were being matched with
              more skilled opponents. I said something to the effect of “oh crap
              I think they’re putting us up against harder players because we’ve
              won too many matches.” But his response was simply “I guess we’ll
              just need to get better” or something to that effect. He wasn’t
              phased. That’s how we should all be with SBMM. You get placed
              against tougher lobbies? “Git gud”.
              <br /><br />
              Overall, I have been switching between both Modern
              Warfare and Cold War multiplayer lately and I find both to be a
              lot of fun. But I only player Modern Warfare when it comes to
              local split-screen because Treyarch has not, after all these
              years, figured out how to implement something that both Infinity
              Ward and Sledgehammer have done without issue in Modern
              Warfare and WWII.</span
            >
            <br /><br />
            <span>Warzone</span><br />
            I admire Activision’s move to free maps, seasonal content and a
            premium Battle Pass. It means the community is less divided as new
            maps are released since nobody has to pay for them anymore. On the
            other hand, the integration of Cold War into Warzone and the summary
            scrubbing of Modern Warfare, which has been made nigh invisible
            since Cold War’s launch despite being one of the biggest hits in
            series history, is a disaster.
            <br /><br />
            For one thing, Warzone plays just like Modern Warfare. The game was
            designed by Raven Software and Infinity Ward in tandem with Modern
            Warfare on the same engine with the same mechanics. So you can
            double-sprint, mount guns and so forth. Movement is the same
            as Modern Warfare. Moving from Black Ops Cold War to Warzone is
            jarring. The two games are nothing alike, and yet here we’ve
            made Cold War and Warzone share a Battle Pass and weapons and all
            the rest.
            <br /><br />
            It doesn’t work. From a business standpoint, it doesn’t even make
            sense. Modern Warfare was only six seasons old when Activision
            killed it. This is absurd. If I were an investor at Activision I
            would be furious. There was so much more money to make off of the
            integration between Warzone and Modern Warfare it’s not even funny.
            But now I can’t even buy cosmetics in the Modern Warfare Item Shop.
            Now there are no new MP maps. It’s all Cold War now, and I’m not
            very inclined to spend cash on that game because I don’t like it as
            much. I’m not alone in this.
            <br /><br />
            What’s the alternative? Well, Activision and Treyarch could have
            gone multiple routes here. They could have released an
            updated Blackout battle royale game that was free-to-play just
            like Warzone. Maybe they didn’t want two competing free-to-play
            battle royales, but I’m not sure that would have been an actual
            problem. Fans of Black Ops would play Blackout. Fans of Modern
            Warfare would play Warzone. Both could have their own battle
            pass/seasonal systems and both could make money while each would
            retain its distinct play-style, mechanics and so forth. Or Treyarch
            could create a live-service, free-to-play Zombies game instead, and
            tie each Black Ops entry to that, leaving Battle Royale to Modern
            Warfare. Zombies is one of the most popular aspects of Black Ops as
            a series, and a free-to-play Zombies game that kept growing and
            expanding with new seasonal content over the years could be a huge
            hit. Either way would be better than what has happened instead—the
            premature death of Modern Warfare, one of my favorite FPSs in years,
            and the awkward, messy intertwining of Cold War and Warzone.
            <br /><br />
            That being said, I’m not entirely critical. I love the new Rebirth
            Island map. It’s much smaller than Verdansk, and new modes like
            Resurgence are great fun. I also like being able to play my Cold War
            Operators in the Warzone engine. And use the Cold War guns in
            the Warzone engine, which I find superior, thus making it the best
            way to play Cold War ironically enough.
            <br /><br />
            But other players might prefer how Cold War plays—which is fine!—and
            would probably love a battle royale that played just like it. So why
            not just release a free-to-play Blackout and have both options for
            players? Modern Warfare/Warzone could have ongoing seasons and a
            Battle Pass and so could Black Ops/Blackout and players could choose
            to play either/or and purchase or not purchase Battle Passes for
            each. Each game would have a distinct feel. If a third game from
            Sledgehammer is in the works still, we could have a third
            free-to-play battle royale to accompany it, replete with seasonal
            content and Battle Pass. Imagine a new WWII game or Advanced
            Warfare game that also had a battle royale. That would be terrific!
            I’d play either of those in a heartbeat, while still rotating
            between Warzone, Blackout and all the rest. I’ll expand on this in a
            separate post, but it’s hard not to talk about it in some depth in a
            review of Cold War. And it will remain an issue for each subsequent
            game Activision tries to tie to Warzone, which is why I really hope
            they consider simply releasing separate (but ongoing, live-service
            style) battle royales for each franchise instead.
            <br /><br />
            <span>Verdict</span><br />
            Overall, I very much enjoy Cold War. I’m glad we’ve gotten away from
            double-jumping and wall-running (though I wouldn’t hate that from
            time to time, just not every year) and I’m even happier we’ve gotten
            away from special Operator powers. I hated the hero shooter aspects
            of Black Ops 3 and 4 with a burning passion and am more than happy
            to return to a more traditional Call Of Duty format. “Boots on the
            ground” is part of that, but I think just having every player have
            the same access to weapons, streaks and so forth is just as
            important.
            <br /><br />
            I also like, at least in theory, the Scorestreak system in play
            here. Killstreaks reward kills, but Scorestreaks reward all types of
            play. Not losing a streak when you die is a nice padding for less
            amazing players. But I still wish they would reward Objectives
            higher in this system (and on the leaderboard). As an Objective mode
            player first and foremost, this is my bias showing through. But why
            even have a Scorestreak system when kills count so much higher? I
            get just as many if not more Killstreaks in Modern Warfare, which
            ironically overall rewards Objective play more.
            <br /><br />
            Graphically and mechanically I think this is a case of one step
            forward, two steps back, but I find myself enjoying the different
            type of play more and more as I play it. It’s a nice change of pace
            from the slower, more “realistic” play in Modern Warfare. If the two
            games weren’t both linked to Warzone, and we could continue to enjoy
            new Modern Warfare content, I think I’d be much happier with Cold
            War overall.
            <br /><br />
            Still, it’s not a bad effort. The campaign is a blast and quite
            unique for Call Of Duty (though not that weird for Black Ops more
            specifically) and multiplayer is a lot of fun if you don’t need
            split-screen which is irredeemably and inexcusably broken. If you’re
            a fan of Black Ops games I think you’ll enjoy this one a lot. If you
            prefer Modern Warfare I suspect you’ll like it less. It’s good, not
            great.

            Germany's <span>DEFEATED SANITY</span> are set to take the Brutal
            Death Metal world by the throat and drag it’s rotting corpse through
            the cobble stone lined streets of Berlin with the release of their
            sixth record, <span>‘THE SANGUINARY IMPETUS’</span>. Diverging ever
            so slightly from the Groove and Slam driven material of 2016’s
            <span>‘Disposal of the Dead // Dharmata’</span>, in favour of the
            decidedly more Technical and Progressive writing style of their 2013
            opus <span>‘Passages into Deformity’</span>. <br /><br />
            I’ve followed Defeated Sanity for many years from a far, and have
            always appreciated their versatility as purveyors of the more
            debauched style of Death Metal - whereas Brutal Death Metal is often
            seen as the less sophisticated cousin of the aforementioned
            sub-genre of Extreme Metal, these savvy Germans bring some welcomed
            flavours to the dinner table for us to feast with ever changing
            tempos and time signatures and virtuous musical abilities that feels
            like controlled chaos is about to unfurl and drag us all into the
            abyss.

            Of their 20+ years in the underground scene,
            Drummer/Multi-Instrumentalist
            <span>Lille Gruber</span> (who also serves as Guitarist on the
            record), joined by Bassist <span>Jacob Schmidt</span> and Vocalist
            <span>Josh Welshman</span> have shown considerable and obvious signs
            of evolution and maturity in their sound; never making the same
            record twice, they have proven to be true masters of their craft,
            constantly pushing the limits of extremity and technical prowess.
            <br /><br />
            Opening this absolute beast of a record is ‘PHYTODIGESTION’,
            beginning with a rather anticlimactic and solemn snare and a kick,
            slowly gaining momentum, building to the first of many ungodly Blast
            beats, coupled with a frenetic Progressive riff section that evokes
            almost instant anxiety and tension, while a descending Bass tapping
            section that seems to just heighten the stress, threatening to
            spiral out of control. Lille Gruber’s Jazz influences shine through
            here with some well executed drum accents and tight fills, all the
            while vocalist Josh Welshman appropriately shreds his vocal chords
            with some of the lowest and most defined Gutturals I’ve ever heard,
            the transition from the lightning fast BDM into the slower slam
            breakdown towards of the end is flawless.
            <br /><br />
            ‘IMPOSED CORPOREAL INHABITATION’ doesn’t fuck around either,
            bludgeoning would be the most appropriate word to use when
            describing this track (let alone the entire album!), the drumming is
            particularly impressive here, fills and blasts intertwine with
            sickening Bass and Guitar riffs and arpeggios in a perfect marriage
            of Brutality and Technicality. Taking a more straight up Death Metal
            approach to the riff structures that bring to mind
            <span>‘Covenant’</span> era <span>‘Morbid Angel’</span> meets
            <span>‘Effigy of the Forgotten’</span> era
            <span>‘Suffocation’</span>, with an emphasis on Groove that keeps
            the tracks momentum moving forward before ending abruptly.

            ></iframe>
            The respite is brief as the beginning of ‘CONCEIVED THROUGH
            SAVAGERY’ almost seamlessly segues from the previous track, showing
            off DS’s superb writing skills. Keeping the same pace throughout,
            barely letting you up to catch your breath until the very end,
            slowing down just enough to lure you into a false sense of security,
            only to bludgeon you once more, ending with an echoing war cry
            before ’ENITITY DISSOLVING ENTITY’ continues the attack with
            constant tempo changes - Slowing to a mid-paced Groove, picking the
            pace back up then slowing down again culminating in a crushing
            Slamming breakdown.
            <br /><br />
            ‘INSECTA INCENDIUM’, the first single released for the album, brings
            back the chaotic wall of sound that Defeated Sanity’s own brand of
            Technical Brutal Death Metal is known for - flourishes of beauty
            writhing amongst the filth - never shying away from the head banging
            slam riffs, transitioning from technical to straight up brutality
            with ease, from mid paced to frighteningly fast in the blink of an
            eye, ’ARBOREOUSLY TRANSFIXED’ follows suit (I get
            <span>‘I, Monarch’</span> era <span>‘Hate Eternal’</span> vibes
            here). The almost cinematic feel of this record is akin to a Movie
            soundtrack - dynamic and relentless in its vision, albeit a
            soundtrack to an entire franchise of Horror films along the lines of
            <span>Hostel</span> or <span>Saw</span>. <br /><br /><iframe
              width="560"

              class="video-2"
            ></iframe>
            The second single ‘PROPELLED INTO SACRILEGE’ though, feels like its
            own stand-alone track, with the first actual break between songs
            with expertly executed arpeggios and tremolo driven guitar and bass
            parts with relentless blasts that seem inhuman. The fact that
            drummer Lille Gruber serves as not only Drummer but also lead
            Guitarist for this record is mind blowing, his writing is
            phenomenal, this makes for a very cohesive writing style that takes
            into account of everything when constructing a record as Technical
            as this.
            <br /><br />
            ‘DRIVELLING PUTREFACTION’ and ‘DISLIMBING THE OSTRACIZED’ are the
            longest offerings on the record and together almost form one very
            long epic song split into two, the former is much slower in pace
            compared with the rest of the material found on this record, and for
            good reason, its pace feels intentionally subdued, a purposeful
            foreshadowing of the absolute beldam that is about to erupt, slowly
            building to the ultimate conclusion until finally the latter - the
            final track unleashes a barrage of sinister riffs and blast beats.
            Tempos and time signatures convulse and atrophy, culminating in the
            most crushingly brutal breakdown I’ve heard probably ever.
            <br /><br />
            A very well written and well thought out album, it does indeed have
            a Soundtrack quality it, I’d recommend listening to it as a whole,
            though every song on its own hits hard, the true power to this
            record lies in its ability to form one cohesive piece, which speaks
            volumes on the bands vision and ability.

            Perth’s <span>Make The Suffer</span> have gone from strength to
            strength since their inception in 2008, despite line-up changes that
            would cripple a lesser band, their sound has continued to evolve -
            beginning their career with Blackened and Symphonic tinged Deathcore
            with their 2012 debut <span>‘Neverbloom’</span> before incorporating
            more Progressive and Metalcore elements and soaring clean vocal
            melodies into their sound with 2015's follow-up
            <span>‘Old Souls’</span> and ramping it up with the release of
            2017’s critically acclaimed <span>‘Worlds Apart’</span>.

            <img

              class="feature-one-img"
              alt="Make Them Suffer - How To Survive A Funeral cover"
            />
            The thing that sets MTS apart is their very tasteful use of synths
            and piano as well as utilizing Sean Harmanis’ impressive vocal range
            juxtaposed with Booka Nile’s angelic cleans providing a rich and
            unique sound in a scene that has otherwise felt stale and formulaic
            in recent years, not to mention Nick McLernon’s furious riffage
            backed up by Jaya Jeffery’s thundering bass and Jordan Mather’s
            tight and meticulous percussion, Make Them Suffer have proven that
            they are force to be reckoned with.
            <br /><br />
            For their much anticipated forth record, entitled 'How to Survive a
            Funeral', Make Them Suffer enlisted none other than
            <span>Drew Fulk a.k.a. WZRDBLD</span> - who has handled production
            duties for Metalcore heavyweights <span>Motionless In White</span>,
            <span>Beartooth</span> and <span>Bullet For My Valentine</span> as
            well as hip-hop luminaries <span>Yelawolf</span> and
            <span>Lil’ Wayne</span> to help them capture what could truly be
            their 'Master Of Puppets' or 'White Album' if you will. The growth
            in the few years of heavy touring since their last release is
            immediately evident and the band have clearly come out the other
            side with some fresh sounds to add to their already stacked bag,
            while still showcasing their trademark down-tuned heaviness, the
            song writing on display here is a considerable leap forward -
            assimilating Pop and Post Hardcore elements that bring a brightness
            to their arrangements while still retaining hints of the melancholy
            wall-of-noise of their Blackened and Death Metal roots.

            The record begins on a sombre note with the short intro track ‘STEP
            ONE’ with the opening vocal line
            <span>“SPEAK FROM YOUR HEART”</span> - which serves as the mission
            statement of sorts for the record accompanied by a bone shattering
            breakdown leading into ‘FALLING ASHES’, with a harsh tremolo riff
            and frantic blast beats that would make Emperor proud - showcasing
            their sheer heaviness and aggression while still maintaining a
            groove that keeps you moving before slowing right down with an
            ominous synth heavy passage, luring you into a false sense of
            security, then blasting your eardrums one last time before ‘BONES’
            kicks in with its rhythmic Progressive/Djent inspired groove and a
            guttural roar, “I CAN'T BREATHE!”, building into a powerful piano
            and chord driven chorus showing off Harmanis’ vocal range with some
            great lyrics - “Shed my skin, take me from my home, I give all I am,
            I give all I own. Shed my skin, steal my heart again, take from me
            my bones”, this song will surely be a staple in their live set for
            years to come. <br /><br />
            ‘DROWN WITH ME’ is a mid-paced banger with solid grooves and guitar
            bends that build into an anthemic chorus showing off the brightness
            I mentioned earlier with well-placed piano and strings that has an
            almost Ballad like feel to it finishing it off with an absolutely
            monstrous half time breakdown. ‘ERASE ME’ begins with a calming
            piano intro before blasting your eardrums once again with lightning
            fast Blackened assault and apocalyptic blast beats, switching to
            Melodic Death inspired riffage, that harkens back to Metalcore’s
            glory days, and yet another beautifully anthemic chorus with some
            really powerful and emotionally charged lyrics - “But you're waiting
            patiently for something worth saving, I've broken you enough so
            don't hate me. But you're waiting patiently for something worth
            saving. Erase me”.

            The latest single ‘SOUL DECAY’ is sure to be a crowd favourite, with
            its mosh heavy riffs and tight grooves, again demonstrating MTS’s
            affinity for catchy yet crushingly heavy song writing, this song
            hits incredibly hard not only for its instrumentation but the
            subject matter of its lyrics - Conjuring up images of the dark side
            of addiction and watching someone you love succumbing to the
            pitfalls of that lifestyle (that is my take away from them
            anyway..).
            <br />
            ‘FAKE YOUR OWN DEATH’ is easily one of if not THE heaviest track on
            the album, showing us that MTS is still very capable of writing an
            absolutely ruthless Deathcore banger - full of breakdowns and in
            your face pissed off aggression and attitude. The lyrics are
            straight forward and angry as fuck, I get an old school
            <span>Slipknot</span> vibe at times in this song which I’m all
            about. If this song doesn’t get the mosh lords moving then I don’t
            know what will. When this song comes on, I’ll see you in the pit.
            <br /><br />
            The title track ‘HOW TO SURVIVE A FUNERAL’ opens with a discordant,
            chaotic riff that that writhes and wails with an almost Southern
            Rock fury - bearing a slight resemblance to early Norma Jean, before
            slowing right down and seamlessly transitioning into an piano led
            section without losing any of its intensity or momentum, led by
            Booka Nile singing - “You barely knew us. You were out of touch, out
            of touch for so long. You filled the room up. And none of us knew we
            cared 'til you're gone”.
            <br /><br />
            ‘THE ATTENDANT’ takes a step away from the heaviness with this slow
            Deftones-esque masterpiece, with flourishes of piano accentuating
            the chord driven riffs and allows Harmanis to shine bright with an
            impassioned vocal performance beautifully harmonized with Nile the
            lyrics are melancholic and self-reflective; dealing with self-doubt
            and depression (again, my take away from it), this song seems quite
            far removed from the rest of the album sonically, but is in fact a
            culmination of the quieter moving parts of their arrangements
            forming a cohesive piece resulting in an absolutely powerful song
            that is one of my favourite songs on the record.

            If we haven’t learned our lesson by now, it’s too never
            underestimate Make Them Suffer’s ability to take its audience by
            surprise by throwing a curveball with it’s final track, ‘THAT’S JUST
            LIFE’, with its electronic drum beat intro like a thumping pulse,
            getting the blood pumping again after slowing it down to a crawl -
            we are greeted once again by the “heavy” MTS. Groove laden riffs and
            bouncy rhythms, bleeding into an earth shattering breakdown, synth
            infused clean vocal passages and fretboard traversing guitar solo
            brings this beast of an album to a close, leaving you breathless and
            wondering what the fuck just happened. After listening to this album
            a few times, its many twists and turns still come as a surprise.
            <br /><br />
            A common theme of this record I feel is the concept of growth, and
            this album shows much growth, not just as musicians but as
            songwriters, and of course as people – no longer obsessed with just
            writing the heaviest record or song as possible for the sake of it,
            but crafting a work of art. And this album is just that. Make Them
            Suffer have created something incredibly special. They should be
            very proud. And you should listen to it.

            Scotland's <span>Bleed From Within</span> up the ante with the
            release of their fifth record, <span>‘Fracture’</span> - Without
            exactly reinventing the wheel when it comes to a modern take of
            extreme metal, but they do take massive step forward creatively by
            effortlessly transitioning from Technical and Melodic Death to
            Groove Metal to classic Metalcore without it sounding contrived or
            forced. <br /><br />
            The first single and first track on ‘Fracture’, 'THE END OF ALL WE
            KNOW' wastes no time with long, drawn out cinematic intros, and
            jumps straight into a ripping Melo Death riff that wouldn't feel out
            of place on an early <span>Soilwork</span> or
            <span>In Flames</span> records, before slowing to a mid-paced groove
            then taking a hard right turn with a breakdown that could only be
            described as the best homage to <span>Decapitated'</span>s
            <span>'Sphere of Madness'</span> I've ever heard - the chorus on the
            other hand is anthemic and catchy as hell, taking me back to the mid
            2000's Metalcore with an impassioned vocal delivery and uplifting
            subject matter really make this song a stand out. <br /><br /><img
              src="https://i1.wp.com/www.rocksins.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Bleed-From-Within-Fracture-Album-Cover.jpg?fit=800%2C800andssl=1"
              class="feature-one-img"
              alt="feature-one-img"
            />
            The Melodic Death and Thrash influences are worn proudly on their
            sleeves with tracks like 'PATHFINDER' and 'FALL AWAY' - Frenetic
            fretboard acrobatics, solid grooves and Scott Kennedy's vocals
            shifting from the mid-low growls to an almost Southern metal vibe
            with a healthy dose of <span>Slayer</span>-isms to keep you moving
            or headbanging or arms crossed, standing at the back of the room,
            nodding occasionally or whatever you do to enjoy your metal - with
            more sing along chorus' to keep the crowd chanting and filthy
            breakdowns to keep the pit monsters sweating. <br /><br />
            'INTO NOTHING' gives the listener a slight reprieve from the
            breakneck speeds with a mid-paced groove driven track and second
            single, the catchy, rhythmic breakdown towards the end of this song
            really gets me going (I get an awesome 'One Kill Wonder' era 'The
            Haunted' vibe here). The title track 'FRACTURE', begins on a somber
            note with haunting spoken words and a powerful chord driven chorus
            that was made for epic crowd sing a longs, with great lyrics to
            boot, before launching into a seizure inducing riff section, that
            wouldn’t feel out of place on an <span>Architects</span>
            record, but BFW make it squarely their own.
            <br /><br />
            The third single, 'NIGHT CROSSING', opens up with a melodic lead
            with a meaty bass tone that builds into a heavy chorus (I get hints
            of early <span>Killswitch Engage</span> and
            <span>As I Lay Dying</span> here) before sidestepping into a calming
            acoustic guitar section with a guest spot from
            <span>Trivium</span> frontman <span>Matt Heafy</span>, who rips a
            typically epic solo, finishing with a crushing breakdown.

            'FOR ALL TO SEE' is another mid-paced offering that hits hard but
            ultimately falls a tad short, losing a bit of momentum and seems to
            serve as more of a prelude to, ‘ASCEND', which brings back the
            intensity and sense of urgency in not only music but also in the
            vocals and lyrics that hit hard like - "I watch the sun drain
            through the cracks in the sky. I'll let you burn for all our hope
            was denied. Watch as the sun drains through the cracks in the sky.
            Return to bone, ascend into the night", with catchy as fuck riffs,
            bouncy mosh parts and sing along chorus' a plenty, this will sure to
            be a crowd pleaser.
            <br /><br />
            ‘UTOPIA’ and closing track ‘A DEPTH THAT NO ONE DARES’ chugs and
            shreds, stacked with more groove infected melodic riffs and the
            occasional dip into dissonant black metal tremolo picking and blast
            beats with chest thumping breakdowns.

            Although the album does follow the familiar structure of
            verse-chorus-breakdown-verse-chorus at times - but they do so
            sparingly and tastefully while also leaning into their strengths in
            writing dynamic songs with catchy riffs, that hearken back to the
            glory days of Swedish death influenced Metalcore with uplifting
            lyrics and plenty of mosh worthy moments to keep the crowd happy.

            <span>‘Love and Monsters’: Fun Times During the End Times</span>
            <br />
            A fun if forgettable family-friendly adventure comedy set in a
            "monster-pocalypse." Who said the end of the world had to be a
            downer?
            <br /><br />
            It’s the end of the world as Joel (Dylan O’Brien) knows it and,
            despite living in an underground bunker for seven years to evade the
            gigantic mutant reptiles, insects and amphibians that now roam the
            earth’s surface, he feels surprisingly fine.
            <span>Michael Matthews</span>’ cheerfully PG-13 adventure comedy
            quickly dispenses with any notional topicality threatened by its
            premise (it would be a reach to relate the comet-strike/radiation
            quandary faced by humanity in its opening moments to our current
            deeply uncool and uncinematic global disaster), but that’s all for
            the best. It leaves “Love and Monsters” free to get on with its
            splattery creature effects and silly but satisfying hero’s journey
            entirely unencumbered by importance. <br /><br />

            Abetted by a disarming, charming O’Brien, liberated from the
            dourness of the last dystopia he battled in the “Maze Runner”
            movies, Matthews delivers a daffily lightweight throwback to the
            teen action-adventures of the ’80s and ’90s. Back then, it was more
            or less routine to summon entire apocalypses into being solely to
            provide some awkward white American kid with an obstacle course on
            which to Prove Himself. So when the previously un-kickass Joel
            splutters triumphantly “I feel like Tom Cruise!” having tossed a
            grenade into the maw of some slavering beastie, it’s a mark of the
            film’s benevolent, infectiously simplistic worldview that we can
            take it at face value. In “Love and Monsters,” love is good,
            monsters are bad and feeling like Tom Cruise is “awesome.”
            <br /><br />￼ In a self-deprecating voiceover, Joel brings us up to
            speed, with the aid of some pencil-drawn animations (he is more
            talented with colouring pencil than with crossbow). In an effort to
            deflect an approaching comet, missiles were sent up, which worked
            fine except the irradiated fragments then dropped down to earth and
            instantly mutated all cold-blooded creatures — cockroaches, worms,
            crabs, etc. — into massive, human-hungry monsters. <br /><br />
            <img
              src="./assets/images/film/promo/love-and-monsters-promo1.jpg"
              alt="Love and Monsters promo"
              class="feature-one-promo"
            />
            Seventeen-year-old Joel was out canoodling with his girlfriend Aimee
            (Jessica Henwick) when disaster struck. They got separated, he
            witnessed his parents’ deaths, and since then he has lived
            underground as the sole single guy in a colony of loved-up
            (exclusively heterosexual) couples. Due to his tendency to freeze in
            the face of danger, Joel’s been left in charge of milking the cow,
            fixing the radio and cooking the minestrone, while the more vigorous
            colony members go on perilous overground forays for food and
            supplies. Charitably, we can infer that this overly protective
            environment has somewhat arrested his development; the weirdest
            thing about “Love and Monsters” might just be that Joel is
            supposedly the ripe old age of 24 while most of it is happening.
            <br /><br />
            Recently, Joel managed to locate Aimee’s colony on the radio, and
            one day (it’s not very well articulated why now exactly), deaf to
            the entreaties of his colony “family,” he embarks on the kamikaze
            85-mile journey to her coastal enclave. Soon he teams up with an
            excellent dog named Boy, then he encounters grizzled old-timer Clyde
            (Michael Rooker) and his precocious 8-year-old sidekick Minnow (an
            excellent Ariana Greenblatt). They teach him some sterling lessons
            in survival, as he’s assailed by a Harkonnen-like frog the size of a
            compact car, a mutant crustacean that would keep Maryland in
            crab-cakes for a year, nasty underground worm-critters Minnow dubs
            “Sand Gobblers” and a slow-moving but insatiable final boss monster
            known as a “Chumbler.”
            <br /><br />
            <span>Brian Duffield and Matthew Robinson</span>’s screenplay was
            apparently written on spec, but the familiar story feels like it was
            based on pre-existing material. That’s largely due to Matthews’
            unapologetic, affectionate appropriation of other films from the
            post-apocalyptic and coming-of-age genres, the sum total of which
            represent a kind of smorgasbord of what “Love and Monsters” is going
            for. Joel and Boy are reminiscent of the equivalent “iconic duo” (as
            Joel dubs them) from “I Am Legend,” and even the dog’s name seems a
            winking reference to 1975’s “A Boy and His Dog,” a far nastier,
            grimier tale of a human-canine pair traversing a mutant-infested
            wasteland on a much less wholesome quest for female companionship.
            When Joel teams up with Clyde and Minnow, the film briefly becomes
            “Zombieland.” The subterranean monsters inevitably recall “Tremors.”
            And when Joel encounters a working MAV1S (a helper robot that feels
            like a subplot that got curtailed in the final pass) and it plays
            Ben E. King’s “Stand by Me,” sure enough, just a few scenes later,
            echoing Rob Reiner’s touchstone film of the same name, Joel emerges
            from a river covered in leeches — though these are of the fist-sized
            poisonously psychedelic kind. <br /><br />￼ The creature design team
            obviously had a good time. It’s a relief to encounter such varied
            and pleasingly lo-fi monsters in an age when everything else seems
            to be a riff on the “Cloverfield” thingamajig. And as slimy, toothy
            and gross as the creatures often are, Lachlan Milne’s sprightly
            photography and Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp’s scrupulously
            generic “let’s go on an adventure!” score never allow for things to
            get too dark. It’s all quite forgettable, but in the moment so
            goodnatured that even the hopeful little “Hi! We could do a sequel!”
            hooks carefully planted throughout can’t spoil the fun. In fact, a
            sequel seems quite an appealing prospect, if we can just, as a
            civilisation, make it our noble, quixotic mission to survive that
            long. <br /><br />￼

            <br /><br />
            How do you solve a problem like reviewing The Hunt? The schlocky
            horror film would ordinarily garner little attention beyond genre
            fans and a handful of critics. But after months of buildup touting
            it as a satire about liberal elites hunting rural Trump voters, the
            film now comes with some baggage.

            <span>The Hunt</span>, directed by <span>Craig Zobel</span> and
            written by Nick Cuse and Damon Lindelof, appears at first glance to
            purposely provoke – one character references “the
            rat-fucker-in-chief”, another talks of “slaughtering a dozen
            deplorables” (a reference to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of
            deplorables” remark). The context of this line becaomes clear when
            the plot gets going: 12 people wake up, gagged and confused, in the
            woods while a mysterious box sits nearby, filled with weapons. (The
            script is loosely inspired by Richard Connell’s 1924 short story The
            Most Dangerous Game, about a rich man who hunts other humans for
            sport.) It doesn’t take long for every variety of death – shooting,
            exploding, stabbing – to descend from a hidden and prepared upper
            class. <br /><br />
            <img
              src="./assets/images/film/promo/the-hunt-promo1.jpg"
              alt="The Hunt promo"
              class="feature-one-promo"
            />
            The violence is gratuitous if cartoonish – one woman is shot at,
            impaled and then blown in half. But The Hunt does play with who to
            root for and who, if anyone, you can trust. Deaths are often swift
            and occasionally surprising; the characters are one-line stereotypes
            – rural woman from Wyoming, white wannabe rapper from Florida,
            Staten Islander who loves guns (Ike Barinholtz), Ivanka fan in
            leggings (Emma Roberts) – and are picked off one by one. The only
            “deplorable” with a clue how to fight back is Crystal (Betty
            Gilpin), a mysterious woman with an even more mysterious knowledge
            of martial arts.
            <br /><br />
            The Hunt’s release in the middle of coronavirus fears in the US is
            another unlucky development in the film’s rollout. It was originally
            slated for release last September, but mass shootings in El Paso,
            Texas, and Dayton, Ohio, prompted a postponement. Soon after,
            details about the film emerged and rightwing anger followed, even
            from Trump himself.
            <br /><br />
            In February, it returned with an updated marketing strategy riffing
            on the controversy. A more spoiler-heavy trailer meant to frame the
            concept as a joke featured the tagline: “The most talked about movie
            of the year is one that no one’s actually seen.” The film-makers
            have claimed they didn’t anticipate any controversy from a film
            pitting “liberal elites” against “deplorables” in a violent human
            hunt, which seems like lobbing a mock grenade into a minefield and
            getting upset when people scatter.
            <br /><br />
            Nevertheless, they have something of a point: if you can set aside
            the noise, you’re left with a boilerplate B-movie that doesn’t say
            nearly as much as it thinks it does. The jokes are the words of
            stereotypes spoken with a straight face, an opportunity to have a
            character say “climate change is real”, poke fun at white liberal
            NPR listeners who debate using “black” v “African-American” (“White
            people – we’re the worst,” says one elite in reference to everything
            except his killing), and imbue “did you read that article?” with
            more menace.
            <br /><br />
            Which isn’t to say it completely lacks redeeming qualities, namely
            Gilpin. It’s good fun to watch her slink into a bunker and spit,
            “Bye, bitch,” or drawl through a rendition of The Tortoise and the
            Hare that ends in more violence. She bounces back from various
            injury in a matter of seconds and has a genuinely entertaining
            one-on-one fight with Hilary Swank, as chief elite villain.
            <br /><br />
            The rest of the satire, however, struggles to translate. In creating
            characters that embody the worst stereotypes of America’s political
            poles, and making America’s divide as literal and violent as
            possible, The Hunt feigns a viewpoint rather than actually putting
            one forward. It takes aim at everyone, redeeming no one. Which feels
            circular, and queasy, and takes us right back where we started: some
            empty talk about a divided nation, and a film not worthy of this
            much conversation.

            <span>Is ‘The New Mutants’ The Worst ‘X-Men’ Movie Ever?</span>
            <span
              >Fox (and now Disney’s) groundbreaking (if
              inconsistent) X-Men franchise deserved a better send-off than this
              nothing-burger of a movie.</span
            >
            <br /><br />
            Note: I’m not going to lecture you about attending movie theaters,
            since we’re all adults. But I will note that I saw this at a
            drive-in late last night, and that Disney is reporting that the film
            earned $750,000 in preview screenings. Even noting 62% nationwide
            capacity, that still would have been around $1.25 million in preview
            grosses in 100% of the country which (using plausible comparisons)
            would have been an opening of between $13 million and $21 million
            for the weekend. At the moment, we might expect a $7 million-$13
            million Fri-Sun debut.
            <br /><br />
            Putting aside the circumstances of its release, both in terms of
            being delayed for over two years (mostly due to shenanigans related
            to Disney DIS +0.5% buying Fox in mid-2019) and being the first
            “major” studio release dropped into nationwide theatrical release
            after months pandemic-related theater closures, The New Mutants is a
            miserable motion picture. It’s a monotonous, redundant and
            irrelevant fantasy flick that fails to commit to being a teen
            melodrama, a YA fantasy or a horror movie, instead offering
            half-assed components of all three. Despite a strong cast, the
            all-too-rare presence of an LGBTQIA romance between two lead
            characters and a few moments of visual inventiveness, Josh Boone and
            Knate Lee’s The New Mutants boils down to being, yes, a terrible
            feature-length prequel for a sequel that absolutely no one will ever
            want to see.

            The film concerns five teens who reside in an abandoned hospital run
            by Dr. Cecilia Reyes (Alice Braga). Long-story short, they are all
            mutants with unusually dangerous powers who have unintentional (or,
            in one case, righteously intentional) blood on their hands and are
            under supervision until they learn to control their powers. Dani
            Moonstar (Blu Hunt) enters the fray after her entire reservation is
            wiped off the map in the film’s cryptic prologue, and even though
            she doesn’t yet know what her mutant power is she is considered a
            danger to others. As Dani struggles to figure out what she can or
            can’t do, while romantically bonding with persecuted lycan Rahne
            Sinclair (Maisie Williams), the teens begin to experience terrifying
            visions linked to their own respective traumas. But all is not as it
            seems.

              class="feature-one-promo"
            />
            The film does indeed take place within the world of
            Fox’s X-Men series, although that franchise’s random continuity
            negates much interconnectivity. There’s, at best, a few verbal
            references to the X-Men and a fleeting non-verbal reference to
            Charles Xavier, a character who either still runs the Xavier School
            For Gifted Youngsters (X-Men: Days of Future Past) or left the
            school to Hank McCoy after his attempts to control Jean Grey went
            awry (Dark Phoenix). Regardless, these aren’t exactly flagship
            characters, and nobody wears anything resembling a comic book
            costume, so the film has to stand on its own as a spin-off that just
            happens to take place in an existing universe. While the film could
            be commended for being a full-throated genre approximation, it still
            plays out as expected in terms of comic book superhero expectations.
            <br /><br />
            Due to obvious franchise aspirations, we have five primary
            characters who all get introductions, sequences where they show off
            their powers, scenes where they lay out their respective traumatic
            “origin story” and set-pieces where they fend off haunted visions.
            Yes, that’s a lot of leg work for a 90-minute movie. The monotony
            and redundancy resembles It, which also spent much of its running
            time with somewhat stand-alone sequences of its unkillable main cast
            being attacked by specifically-tailored terrors. That film at least
            had more than just stand-alone scare sequences and didn’t entirely
            take place in a single visually drab interior locale. Considering
            Fox allegedly first demanded reshoots after It made $700 million
            worldwide, it’s ironic that New Mutants (essentially what Boone shot
            in 2017) has all of It’s weakness and none of its strengths.
            <br /><br />
            Anya Taylor-Joy makes for a compelling Illyana Rasputin, presented
            as a victim of child slavery (and presumably rape) and she cuts a
            striking action figure in the film’s fantastical climax. None of the
            other kids (including Henry Zaga’s Roberto da Costa and Charlie
            Heaton’s Sam Guthrie), all of whom have done fine work elsewhere,
            make an impression. Braga barely allows her voice to rise above a
            whisper. Save for fleeting past-tense cameos, those six people are
            the only characters in the movie. The 90-minute flick consists of
            these five youngsters going through a standard TV pilot-style heroic
            awakening with the presumption that they’ll be the marquee
            characters/heroes fans wanted to see in the next movie.
            Considering Dark Phoenix’s failure and Disney’s presumed intent to
            reboot X-Men into the existing MCU, this route is especially cruel.
            <br /><br />
            Lacking marquee characters and existing as a feature-length
            prologue, The New Mutants fails as a teen melodrama and, partially
            because we know none of the core cast is in any danger, as a horror
            movie. Whether it justifies itself as an X-Men movie is irrelevant
            since it is a very bad X-Men movie, the worst of the franchise. At
            least X-Men Origins: Wolverine had multiple locations, multiple
            characters and big-scale comic book action that resembled a trashy
            1980’s Cannon flick. New Mutants’ visuals are generally drab, and
            the few moments of fantastical color lit up the screen. All due
            credit for an inclusive cast and a front-and-center same-sex
            romance, and with a note that Boone’s The Fault in Our Stars was one
            of the best movies of 2014, The New Mutants is like watching a lousy
            TV pilot for a show that you know didn’t get picked up.

            />
            Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare is half prequel, half reboot to
            the Modern Warfare franchise. The game takes place before the events
            of Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, but since this is a re-imagining
            of the entire story, developer Infinity Ward still has plenty of
            room to not simply revisit the events of those earlier games, but
            alter and expand upon them however they see fit.<br />
            It’s also a return to a more grounded, realistic military shooter
            after years of futuristic entries (Call Of Duty:
            WWII notwithstanding). Gone are advanced mobility
            mechanics–double-jumping and wall-running–and good riddance. You’re
            still able to slide into a crouch, and Infinity Ward has added
            door-mechanics that allow you to either open doors slowly or burst
            through, making your entrances that much more dramatic.
            <br /><br />
            Likewise, the hero-shooter aspects of Black Ops 3 and 4 are no
            more–and good riddance to that, as well. You have different
            operators to play as in multiplayer, but there are no special powers
            cluttering up matches. In Special Ops Operators do have passive and
            active abilities, but that’s co-op and it’s still toned down from
            what we saw in last year’s game.<br />
            And unlike Black Ops 4, Modern Warfare has a complete single-player
            campaign that’s well worth playing.<br />
            I’m a sucker for a good Call Of Duty campaign, and I’ll be very
            upfront about this: I like almost all of them. Some are better than
            others, but they’re always entertaining. Besides, you can fine-tune
            the difficulty to exactly the level of challenge you want.
            <br /><br />
            <span>The Campaign</span><br />
            I played Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare’s campaign on “Hardened” which
            means I died regularly but never got stuck. I’m going to play it
            again on “Veteran” to really amp up the challenge, but “Hardened” is
            a pretty good balance between challenge and fun. “Your skills will
            be strained” about sums it up.<br />
            In any case, I know there’s been some controversy over the game’s
            historical accuracy, but I’m going to review it based on my
            experience playing rather than nit-picking the historical accuracy
            of a game that makes no pretense at being anything other than a
            total fiction.<br /><img

            The country of Urzikstan is make-believe, and while the regional
            politics certainly resemble the conflicts we find ourselves
            embroiled in in that part of the world, the game is using fictional
            heroes, villains and events and that’s perfectly fine.<br />
            There’s all kinds of historical fiction out there, with made-up
            countries and conflicts, whether we’re talking about books, movies
            or video games. I’m more interested in other questions, such as: Was
            the story entertaining? Was it well-written and well-acted? Was it
            believable and coherent within the parameters set by the fiction?
            Did it make me feel things? Did it speak to about the larger issues
            of war in the modern age?<br />
            I’ve played every single Call Of Duty campaign since Call Of Duty 4:
            Modern Warfare (and a couple of the pre-Modern Warfare campaigns as
            well) and I’ve enjoyed some more than others. Some of my favorites
            include Call Of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, Modern Warfare 2, Black
            Op and Black Ops 2, World at War, WWII and Advanced Warfare.<br />
            Where the Modern Warfare campaign sits in the rankings of all those
            games is hard to say, but it’s some of the most fun I’ve had since
            the Modern Warfare trilogy, and I’d probably put it right
            above Black Ops 2 which I enjoyed immensely.<br />
            <br /><br />
            <span>Story And Missions</span><br />
            For the purposes of this review, I will avoid spoilers as much as
            possible beyond the basic premise stuff. You should play the
            campaign yourself to experience its various twists and turns.<br />
            Captain Price (this time played by the very talented Barry Sloane)
            returns from the original, though he takes a far greater role in
            this game than in CoD4. There are some other familiar faces, as
            well, though Price looms largest.<br />
            Most of the other characters are new. A talented cast paired with
            impressive writing and almost lifelike facial graphics and animation
            makes every cutscene enjoyable.<br />
            The game’s two primary playable characters are Alex (Chad Michael
            Collins), an American CIA operative, and Kyle Garrick (Elliot
            Knight), a British soldier in the SAS. You’ll play as freedom
            fighter Farah Karim (Claudia Doumit) but only in very short
            instances.<br />
            Like the previous Modern Warfare games and first two Black
            Ops games, the story takes place in “modern” times. This isn’t
            historical or futuristic. Most of the story takes place in fictional
            Urzikstan though some of it takes place elsewhere, including the
            UK.<br />
            The story pits three factions against one another. There’s the
            united US/UK forces who team up with Farah’s freedom fighters; the
            brutal Russian occupiers of Urzikstan led by Roman Barkov; and the
            terrorist group Al-Qatala led by Omar "The Wolf" Sulaman. Various
            twists and turns throughout the campaign tinker with this
            three-pronged dynamic, and you begin to realize that it’s not at all
            as cut and dry as it seemed at first, but I won’t spoil any of
            that.<br />
            <img
              src="./assets/images/games/promo/cod-modern-warefare-promo2.jpg"
              alt="Call of Duty - Modern Warfare Review Promo Photo"
              class="feature-two-promo"
            />
            The game largely takes place in the present timeline, but
            occasionally dips back into Farah and her brother Hadir’s backstory.
            These are the sequences you play as Farah (for the most part).
            Everything else switches between Alex and Kyle, and you’ll bounce
            all over the place for these missions.<br />
            The game often nods to past Modern Warfare titles, with some
            sequences mirroring (though not replicating) some of the best
            moments in CoD4. For instance, at one point you have to crawl under
            a truck in a convoy, and then moments later lay in a field of bodies
            as a troop of Russian soldiers walks slowly past. This is certainly
            reminiscent of “All Ghillied Up” though much briefer and less
            original. There’s another scene where you briefly fire rockets and
            down on tiny little enemy soldiers and tanks that’s
            like CoD4’s Death From Above mission but again, much more brief and
            much more part of the breathtaking action rather than the almost
            detached brutality of the original.
            <br /><br />
            There are other, similar scenes but I won’t spoil any. I don’t mind
            these callbacks at all, to be honest, though I’m not sure the game
            ever quite rises to the level of CoD4 simply because it relies too
            often on these moments rather than creating new sequences as
            memorable.<br />
            Perhaps the most memorable sequence in Modern Warfare 2019 takes
            place in the UK when Kyle and Captain Pierce, along with other
            special forces units, clear out a building with terrorists and
            civilians inside, including women and children. I accidentally shot
            one of the women a terrorist was using as a human shield. I felt bad
            about it, too. Another woman pulled a gun on us as we cleared the
            building. It was hard to know who was a target and who was a
            civilian.<br />
            From start to finish, Modern Warfare’s campaign is a tense,
            challenging, brutal and beautiful experience. It’s Call Of Duty, so
            don’t expect the most emotional or profound story. Expect an
            intense, action-packed shooter with plenty of military jargon, some
            surprisingly relatable characters, and lots of violence. It’s an
            excellent campaign and I’m thrilled that Infinity Ward has taken the
            franchise back to its Modern Warfare roots.<br />
            I will say that one character’s ending left me a little cold. It
            seemed to abrupt and too played down for what it was. But for the
            most part, I loved how the game ended–the denouement and
            post-credits scenes are excellent–and how it opens up so many
            possibilities for the future of this series.<br />
            <br /><br />
            <span>Multiplayer</span><br />
            Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare’s multiplayer comes with two halves:
            Competitive multiplayer and co-operative Special Ops. Progression
            carries over between these two modes, and bits of story also cross
            over between the campaign and Special Ops, while multiplayer maps
            are often clearly inspired by levels in the campaign.<br />
            There’s been much ado over Modern Warfare’s map design, which is
            quite different from recent Call Of Duty games, largely (though not
            entirely) abandoning the three-lane map structure of past maps in
            favor of more open-ended maps. Many of these maps are littered with
            camping positions. This, combined with a brutally fast TTK
            (time-to-kill) can lead to a more cautious play-style, which some
            people feel is more tactical and others hate.
            <br /><br />
            I love it, quite frankly. It took me a little while to get used to
            the new maps and play-style, but I really enjoy them now, including
            ones I didn’t like much at first such as Piccadilly, an urban map
            set in London replete with large buses, city streets and cramped
            indoor areas.<br />
            Other maps include more traditional three-lane-ish fare like Gun
            Runner or Hackney Yard. Still others are sprawling, such as Aniyah
            Palace, which almost feels too big for its own good.<br />
            Runnig-and-gunning may not work as well as it used to, but just
            because Modern Warfare is a bit slower and more tactical hardly
            means it’s slow or boring. Yes, you might get killed by campers more
            often, but you that just means you have to adjust your play-style a
            bit. Be more cautious. Learn where people like to camp. I know,
            change is hard. But in this case, I think it’s also very good.<br />
            Gameplay is essentially what you’ve come to expect from Call Of
            Duty though there’s some nice little additions like the ability to
            mount your gun on most surfaces, whether that’s the corner of a wall
            or a crate you’re using for cover. This is a great feature that I
            hope the franchise continues to use in later games.
            <br /><br />
            There’s some cool little changes to the game’s structure that make
            it even more enjoyable. The “Pick 10” system is gone, allowing you
            to customize your loadout in much greater depth. Customization is
            deepened further by the gunsmith system, which allows you to tinker
            with numerous attachments for each of your weapons, each with some
            kind of pro and con–improve stability but slow aim-down-sights (ADS)
            and so forth.<br />
            Better still, you can change loadouts and attachments mid-match,
            something long overdue in this series. Not happy with your assault
            rifle? Or just the scope you chose? Maybe you’d like to try out some
            different perks? That can all take place while in a match. It’s very
            cool.<br />
            Multiplayer also now has a whole bunch of different types of match
            beyond traditional game modes like Domination, Team Death Match and
            so forth. It has all those, but there’s also now, on top of 6 vs 6,
            10 vs 10, 20 vs 20 and even 32 vs 32 in Ground War, which is
            basically Call Of Duty’s version of Battlefield. One of the best new
            modes is Gunfight, which pits teams of two against one another with
            preset, randomly cycling loadouts for quick-burst matches on tiny
            maps. This is a fast-paced, incredibly competitive mode that’s a
            real blast, especially if you have a solid teammate–i.e. it’s best
            if you play with a friend rather than randoms.<br />
            <br /><br />
            <span>Special Ops.</span><br />
            That’s also true of Special Ops, Modern Warfare’s cooperative
            multiplayer. This replaces Zombies (finally) and is a nice break
            from that mode. Special Ops is comprised of Operations, Missions
            and, on PS4, Survival modes. Operations are story-driven objective
            stages; Missions are shorter, less involved tests of skill; and
            Survival Mode–a wave-based horde mode–is exclusive to PS4 until Oct
            1st, 2020. I’ve enjoyed the Operations quite a bit so far, but your
            success really does depend on your team actually playing like a
            team, and that’s tricky with randoms. It’s tricky enough in
            competitive multiplayer in objective-based modes like Domination
            when half your team just wants kills instead of playing the
            objective–it’s even harder when you play with teams in Special Ops
            who have no interest in reviving downed teammates or sticking
            together. That’s not the mode’s fault, of course, but it is a
            challenge to overcome.<br />
            All told, the sheer breadth of mutliplayer options on offer
            in Modern Warfare gives players an astounding amount of stuff to do,
            modes to play, challenges to overcome. Speaking of which, there are
            daily and special challenges (get X number of kills with a shotgun
            style) available now and once the Battle Pass is live I’m sure there
            will be more. I’m having the most fun I’ve had in multiplayer since
            War Mode was introduced in Call Of Duty: WWII, which reminds me that
            I really wish this game had War Mode. Oh well. You can’t have
            everything.
            <br /><br />
            Other changes from last year’s game include the return to
            auto-healing. Infinity Ward was wise to remove this from multiplayer
            (an annoying change in Black Ops 4) as well as the campaign (an
            annoying change in WWII) and so we’re back to traditional
            auto-healing where the screen gets faded around the edges when
            you’re hurt and you hear pounding in your ears.<br />
            And to top it all off, you now can play against friends on other
            platforms. For the first time, Call Of Duty is launching with
            crossplay between PC, PS4 and Xbox One, with a variety of options to
            make sure you’re not going up against mouse-and-keyboard players
            with a controller if you don’t want to. That means you can play with
            your friends who don’t own a console, or with your brother who owns
            an Xbox One instead of a PS4 like you. It’s terrific.<br />
            <br /><br />
            <span>Graphics and Sound</span><br />
            Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare CREDIT: INFINITY WARD Call Of Duty:
            Modern Warfare might just be the most photo-realistic video game
            I’ve ever played. The faces are just about as close to “real” as
            I’ve ever seen in a game. It’s gorgeous, especially on PC with
            ray-tracing enabled. (Though you’ll want to turn down film-grain on
            PC, at least. It makes everything look muddy, at least in MP).<br />
            I played on PS4 and PC and while both are incredible looking,
            there’s no doubt that PC is the winner. The game is at times simply
            jaw-dropping, especially in the campaign which is lush with various
            environments, massive explosions and the ridiculously lifelike
            faces.
            <br /><br />
            The sound design is as on point as ever, minus the overly-loud
            footsteps at launch and the overaggressive “chatter” in multiplayer.
            These have been toned down, thankfully. The excellent weapon sound
            design is one reason why this franchise’s gunplay is so good. Like
            the graphics, the sound design has improved over the years and it
            just makes the shooting that much tighter and more intense.<br />
            Meanwhile, the original score by Sarah Schachner is excellent–an
            intense musical companion to the intense campaign. It’s not my
            favorite Call of Duty OST–in modern memory, I’m quite partial
            to WWII’s OST by Wilbert Roget II and its sweeping horns. But this
            one is quite good, especially in its Middle Eastern pieces like
            “Farah.”<br />
            The game looks and sounds incredible. It’s almost a shame so many
            ugly things happen in the campaign. Such beauty juxtaposed with such
            ugliness.
            <br /><br />
            <span>Bugs and Other Issues</span><br />
            So far, I’ve had very few issues with this game. I know that is not
            the case for many others. I’ve spent the vast majority of my time
            reviewing Modern Warfare on PC rather than PS4, and the worst issues
            I’ve personally encountered were graphical fiascos in
            multiplayer.<br />
            Once, I entered a match and had to quit because the light was so
            bright I couldn’t see anything. It was like I’d just been to the eye
            doctors and had my eyes dilated and then walked brazenly into a
            bright, sunny day. At times the images have just become massively
            distorted and glitched out.<br />
            I haven’t had any crashes, however, though I know this has plagued
            the Xbox community in particular and the PC community as well. Word
            of warning, then, you may experience crashes and other errors I
            haven’t experienced.
            <br /><br />
            People have also complained about the SBMM (skill-based matchmaking)
            but I haven’t noticed anything too terrible. Sure, at times I’m more
            on point than others, and at times it seems like I’ve been matched
            against players that are just ridiculously better than me and my
            team, but that’s always been an issue with Call Of Duty and plenty
            of other competitive online games.<br />
            I’ve also heard complaints about netcode and lag compensation but
            for the most part (on my very fast internet connection) I haven’t
            noticed anything too egregious, and I suspect that these are blown
            out of proportion, as per usual.<br />
            As far as joining matches goes, I’ve had a pretty easy time of it,
            usually finding new matches in well under a minute and loading in
            quickly and without issues.
            <br /><br />
            I’ve played on two different desktops–my newer machine has an AMD
            Ryzen 3700X CPU, an RTX 2080 Super GPU, is entirely SSD-based with
            32 GB RAM; my older PC has an i7-6700K CPU, a GTX 1080 GPU, a
            mixture of SSD and traditional HDs, and 16 GB of RAM. It runs great
            on either machine, though the older one doesn’t have ray-tracing and
            can’t run it at quite as high of settings. I’ve played on QHD
            monitors, aka 2560x1440 resolution and have had no frame-rate issues
            whatsoever.<br />
            In any case, many of these issues should be ironed out with patches.
            From my personal experience, there’s nothing game-breaking going on,
            but Xbox One X players in particular have had a rough time with hard
            crashes, so keep that in mind.
            <br /><br />
            <span>Verdict</span><br />
            So far, I’m having a terrific time with Modern Warfare. A return to
            a modern setting is exactly the game I’ve wanted for years now, and
            I’m thrilled that Infinity Ward has found its groove again after
            some fumbles. While I enjoyed both Ghosts and Infinite Warfare, I
            didn’t love either game. Infinite Warfare had a pretty good
            campaign, but I was much less impressed with the futuristic gameplay
            in multiplayer. Modern Warfare gets the series back to its roots
            with plenty of nods to the 2007 original, but it also does enough to
            keep the game fresh and exciting, and it looks simply stunning on
            both console and PC. A strong campaign, tons of multiplayer options
            including big team Ground War and 2 vs 2 Gunfight, and a break from
            Zombies co-op with the return of Special Ops–what’s not to love?
            <br /><br />
            It is important to note that the Battle Pass system has not yet been
            implemented. This year, all post-launch maps will be free and
            Activision has stated that loot boxes / supply drops are no more.
            Instead, there will be a seasonal Battle Pass a la Fortnite, with
            cosmetic rewards that you earn through play. This is all excellent
            news, but since they haven’t included it in the game yet I can’t say
            for sure whether it’s a good system or not. I’ll update this review
            accordingly once that happens. Hopefully Activision doesn’t pull any
            funny business, introducing loot boxes or paid maps down the
            road–but I wouldn’t put it past them.<br />
            Still, all signs point to major improvements in terms of post-launch
            revenue and hopefully it stays that way. Hopefully Infinity Ward
            also keeps communicating with players about the issues they’re
            having with the game, as open communication is vital to the
            community and game.<br />
            In any case, if you’ve been holding off on buying new Call Of
            Duty games, or if you’re just sick of the futuristic shooters or the
            hero-shooter aspects of Black Ops 4, this is the perfect time to
            return to the series. Even if you just play for the campaign, I
            think this one is worth your time and money. I give it a Buy on my
            Buy/Hold/Sell rating.<br />

            As the first new project from <span>Rockstar Games</span> this
            generation, it feels like a lot is riding on Red Dead Redemption 2.
            The prequel is predictably loaded with the gameplay improvements and
            unexpected oddities that make other Rockstar open-worlds so
            attractive. But now the whole system is designed to give you more
            choices and make you feel more connected, no matter how you decide
            to spend your time. The effect it achieves is remarkable.
            <br /><br />
            You control outlaw Arthur Morgan, an elite member of the Dutch van
            der Linde gang. You start in the snow-packed mountains after barely
            surviving a botched robbery. Dutch and family take shelter from the
            harsh weather while plotting to regain their fortune and seek
            revenge on their enemies. As you make more money and cause more
            trouble, the gang is forced to keep moving to new safe spots and to
            find new towns to rob.
            <br /><br />
            Unlike the bounty-focused revenge crusade in Red Dead Redemption,
            Arthur’s story is more about secrecy and survival. Most missions are
            done to fill your pockets with cash and grow the gang. While you
            won’t learn much about Arthur’s past beyond a few news clippings,
            photographs, and casual conversations, the personalities that
            surround you keep the story approachable and grounded. Newcomers to
            Red Dead should have no problem following along, but there are lots
            of gratifying moments for series fans. The central campaign lasts
            for dozens of hours, excluding the many bonus threads you’ll pick up
            while traveling, and it concludes with an epilogue that vastly
            exceeds expectations.
            <br /><br />
            <img
              src="./assets/images/games/promo/red-dead-redemption-2-promo1.jpg"
              alt="Red Dead Redemption 2 Promo Photo"
              class="feature-two-promo"
            />
            The missions team you up with individual gang members right away and
            they keep giving you chances to understand each person’s
            perspective, whether it’s a black man confronting racism, or a
            Native American watching the government betray his people. You’re
            given a lot of choice, and certain objectives can be skipped if
            you’re not in the mood. Conversations evolve depending on the order
            you complete quests, and prior events are often referenced by the
            people you work with. Outside of these jobs, you can catch up with
            your associates back at camp.
            <br /><br />
            Your movable hideout functions as a conduit for each chapter’s
            events. You can chat with friends to pass the time and upgrade the
            camp visually with perfectly harvested animal skins. You can add or
            improve the available supply storage, and other members will donate
            money to the cause when they can. With hours of animation and
            dialogue to set each scene, the camp is impressively realized, and
            it’s delightful to pause your progress and slowly sip a cup of
            coffee on a cold morning or sit and listen to a guitar by the
            campfire after a rough day.
            <br /><br />
            Details like this, that give the world life, are everywhere. A
            million little moments just waiting to surprise you. You can provoke
            your surroundings by targeting people, animals, or objects with the
            left trigger. Your choices shift depending on the context, so you
            use the same lock-on method to brush your horse, rob a store, or
            talk to strangers. Whether you chat with every person or not, it
            feels good to know the option is there. Gang members will only have
            one or two-line replies at any given time, but even that adds a
            tremendous amount of character to the proceedings.
            <br /><br />
            As you pillage the land, your honor will be questioned. Good and bad
            deeds effect what you see as events unfold, whether they’re part of
            the story or just the way you treat people. We chose the righteous
            path and definitely felt Arthur struggle with his beliefs as seeds
            of doubt and distrust grew within the gang. You’ll see the world
            react to your deeds, as certain items may cost less or jobs might
            pay more. Your honor level effects the decisions you’re given, the
            side missions you discover, and the finale you get when the long
            road finally ends.
            <br /><br />
            These parts aren’t the only ways the game forces immersion on the
            player. There are numerous restrictions that can be a bit
            cumbersome, but also tie you closer to the world and make you
            respect the tools you’re given. You have to eat and drink to restore
            how fast you regenerate health and stamina. Weapons require
            maintenance, which you can perform manually, or you can pay the gun
            clerk to service them for you. You have to dress for hot or cold
            weather or your stamina will be adversely affected. Your horse can
            only carry a small amount of animals or skins. Plus, you have to
            figure out which weapons you need to take with you since you can
            only shoulder two weapons when you’re off your horse, aside from
            your holstered pistols.
            <br /><br />
            Horses require attention as well since they also have depleting
            health and stamina. It takes a while to bond with a horse, which
            will increase its stats and allow you to perform tricks or call it
            from greater distances. You can brush it, feed it, or pat it to
            lighten its mood, and agitated horses might be one gunshot or animal
            attack away from throwing you from the saddle. Missions will give
            you a horse when you need one, but otherwise, you need to keep tabs
            on your trusty steed. If it’s too far away, you have to track it
            down or get back to a stable or camp to spawn it.
            <br /><br />
            These commitments might seem extreme, but they serve a greater
            purpose. Red Dead Redemption 2 has a very slow and deliberate pace
            that makes sense considering the setting and story. Comforting a
            stressed animal, tying rabbits or turkeys to the side of your
            saddle, or carefully choosing your customized arsenal before a
            firefight brings you closer to the lifestyle of the era, and Arthur
            himself. These actions help you build personal attachments to
            everything, and the small doses of reality never slow things down
            too much or spoil the experience.
            <br /><br />
            Fast travel also has its limits. You can take trains and
            stagecoaches to towns you’ve discovered, and you can purchase the
            ability to skip to a location directly from your bedside, but you
            can no longer zip to somewhere from a campfire on the open road.
            Campfires instead now allow you to craft special types of ammunition
            and cook meat you find while hunting.
            <br /><br />
            The extra riding required to get everywhere leads to some of the
            game’s most rewarding and spontaneous moments. Animal parts you
            collect from hunting can be used to upgrade your inventory space,
            create stat-boosting trinkets, feed the gang, or net you extra cash.
            Strangers, and other random events, pop up constantly. These might
            open up new types of items to go searching for, give you a chance to
            adjust your honor meter, or alert you to other means of making
            money. You’re free to help, rob, loot, kill, or ignore these people
            as you see fit.

              class="feature-one-promo"
            />
            Different gangs also occupy each area. They’ll hassle you or the
            locals and set up traps for you to spring on the trail. Dead Eye
            returns to help you pick off targets in slow motion, but now there’s
            also Eagle Eye for gathering plants, searching for clues, and
            tracking beasts. All the info you acquire is stored in a compendium,
            and certain memories are preserved in Arthur’s journal. It’s
            satisfying to fill in each part of the map and discover new towns,
            but things are still happening in places you’ve already visited and
            surprises keep popping up even after the end credits roll. If you
            need a break from the outlaw life, you can play an assortment of
            card and dice games, see a live show or movie, or bring in a bounty
            and partake in that set of unique stories and colorful characters.
            <br /><br />
            This world is alive with people to meet and animals to find, and
            your methods of interacting with them are impressive, but the game’s
            visuals transport you to another time and place more than anything
            else. The customization options with your weapons, clothing, and
            horses are of the highest quality and they’re easy to obsess over.
            Hair takes time to adjust as you have to grow it before you can cut
            it. The lighting has clearly received special attention,
            particularly when rays from the sun cut through foggy forests, rain
            dumps down, and lightning crackles in the distance. Likewise, towns
            become illuminated with a soft glow against the heavy darkness of
            night. Fire appears to completely consume certain objects when lit,
            wood splinters as you use boxes or posts for cover in gunfights, and
            new buildings are constructed as the story goes on.
            <br /><br />
            Navigating the map is one wow moment after another, and just when
            you start to get used to how beautiful the game is, it hits you
            again with another stunning view. Even little animations like when
            Arthur puts his rifle over his shoulder or tucks it into the saddle
            give all the elements a satisfying weight and relevance. A
            first-person view lets you play from a different perspective, and
            while we didn’t switch to it that often, it is amusing to keep a
            close eye on people while each scene plays out.
            <br /><br />
            Red Dead Redemption 2 tests the boundaries of interactive immersion.
            Few games look this good, play this well, and have this much to
            offer. It begs you to slow down, turn every page of its dramatic
            tale, and savor every last breathtaking detail. It challenges you to
            be prepared for anything, and make the right decisions when your
            choices matter most. Arthur Morgan is the lead, but the world takes
            center stage to pull you in. With a list of challenges left to
            finish and an online mode launching soon, we plan to spend a lot
            more time in Rockstar’s unparalleled recreation of the old west.<br />

            />
            PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds didn’t invent the last-person-standing
            formula that’s made it one of the most massively successful PC games
            in history, but – over the course of a nine-month-long early access
            period – it certainly turned it into something special. 100 players
            drop onto a sprawling map and fight to the death using whatever
            weapons they can find within a shrinking force-field. This simple,
            bare-bones take on the Battle Royale-style deathmatch foregoes the
            fluff and high time investment of most hardcore survival sims in
            favor of fast, accessible action. The result is a tight, focused,
            no-frills experience that’s as exciting as it is unpredictable, and
            where no two games are ever alike.
            <br /><br />
            PUBG wastes no time putting you right in the middle of the action as
            you and up to 99 other players airdrop onto one of its two 8x8 km
            maps from the back of a large aircraft. Part of the genius of each
            match’s arc is how heavily it weighs every move you make, and it
            begins with the critical decision of where to land. Jumping early
            along the plane’s randomized flight path lets you hit the ground
            first, giving you a jump on the competition, but risks placing you
            farther from the parts of the arena where the fighting will likely
            funnel as the boundaries contract. Jumping late might distance you
            from other players, giving you some early breathing room and a
            chance to forage for loot in peace before entering the fray.
            Depending on the angle of the flight path, jumping right into the
            center — especially in large cities and other loot-heavy spots —
            could place you right in the middle of the action with some of the
            most trigger-happy opponents.
            <br /><br /><img
              src="./assets/images/games/promo/pubg-promo1.jpg"
              alt="PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds Promo Photo"
              class="feature-one-promo"
            />
            The tension mounts during the descent as you get a good look at the
            swarm of players in your vicinity, but things really pick up the
            moment you hit the ground, as everybody (no matter where you land)
            scrambles for weapons and gear, and the killing kicks off right from
            the get-go. Item distribution is partially randomized, and learning
            the spots on the maps that are likely to spawn military-grade
            weapons and attachments is a good, early strategy to work out on
            your own, with a team of up to four, or using the many fan-made
            resources that already exist thanks to PUBG’s hearty run in Early
            Access. You can’t count on finding a good gun early to keep you
            safe, but unlike similar games like DayZ, where you could
            potentially go long, tedious stretches without finding a weapon,
            there’s bound to be something worth picking up no matter where you
            drop. Backpacks for holding more items, a handful of protective gear
            like helmets and police vests, medical supplies, melee weapons, and
            a good mix of firearms are in good supply.
            <br /><br />
            But no matter what gear you find, PUBG excels at creating a reliable
            and streamlined space for your adventure to play out while also
            allowing for a thrilling level of unpredictability. It isn’t out of
            the ordinary for someone with only a pistol to take down someone
            with a fully loaded SCAR-L assault rifle, since good gear is only
            half the battle — the other half is wit.<br />
            As players outsmart each other in deadly games of cat and mouse,
            those still standing are forced into ever-closer proximity within
            the confines of a deadly, shrinking force-field until just one
            player or team is left alive. Victory (accompanied by the coveted
            “Winner, winner, chicken dinner!” screen) is an exhilarating reward,
            matched only by the suspense that emerges from the battle to achieve
            it. But even if you die early, jumping into a new game is always
            quick and easy.
            <br /><br /><img

              class="feature-one-promo"
            />
            <span>IN THE ZONE</span>
            The deadly, moving force-field that contains the arena and
            occasional airstrikes marked with red on the minimap add a
            consistent sense of purpose that drives you toward conflict, and
            with it, an exciting set of options. You might want to prioritize
            reaching the center of the circle to make the next incremental
            reduction in size of the survivable area easier to deal with; move
            slowly along the borders to pick off stragglers as they rush into
            the open to avoid the oncoming doom; or even hide in a building
            until you absolutely have to move, letting everyone else kill each
            other so you don’t have to. Hopping into a vehicle, like the speedy
            but vulnerable motorbike and buggy, the sturdy closed-top UAZ, or
            the slow-but-durable van — among others — is a quick, fun, and
            conspicuous way to cover a lot of ground, and can result in some
            hilarious and explosive encounters. Either way, you’re encouraged to
            stay on the move, but still have a set of options that lets you pick
            your pace. An aggressive approach is just as viable as a cautious
            defense, and the practicality of both playstyles is refreshingly
            liberating, bringing new sets of challenges that are just as fun to
            plan around and tackle as the next.
            <br /><br />
            The incentives to stay on the move no matter your chosen pace forces
            ever more dangerous encounters with increasingly skilled (or lucky)
            survivors, condensing the action and ending a match after around 20
            minutes, before it can get bogged down by campers or other
            distractions. Action isn’t hard to find if you’re looking for it,
            and impossible to avoid for long when you’re not, but PUBG manages
            to put enough space between encounters to keep those quiet, tense
            moments of cautious exploration intact.
            <br /><br />
            The two large maps aren't the best-looking environments in gaming,
            but they do provide much-needed variety on the battlefield. Both the
            forested island of Erangel and the sunny desert of Miramar boast an
            assortment of small towns, large, dense cityscapes, and rural
            industrial zones ripe with loot. There are some parallels between
            maps so as not to restrict your options when you’re dropped randomly
            into either one (the server picks for you). For instance, the small
            military base on an island off the coast of Erangel sees its match
            in Miramar’s remote military camp, for the high-risk players looking
            to compete for high-level equipment right off the bat.
            <br /><br />
            But both maps have their own unique merits, too. The abundance of
            trees on Erangel provides plenty of cover, even for groups of four,
            while the sparser, rockier Miramar makes moving across open areas on
            foot and in vehicles much more dangerous. While some areas in
            Miramar feel more isolated than even the most secluded spots on
            Erangel, the diversity of elevations, more interesting city layouts,
            and some great map-exclusive weapons — like a sawed-off shotgun that
            fits conveniently in the sidearm slot — more than make up for it.
            Adapting to new challenges and making last-minute decisions based on
            each of these factors is part of the fun. But no matter what you’re
            facing, an abundance of loot in even the smallest buildings in both
            maps ensures hunting for a weapon is never a frustrating task, which
            not only keeps the playing field balanced and fun for everyone, but
            ripe for all sorts of thrilling confrontations.
            <br /><br />
            You might find yourself involved in a frantic shootout in the woods,
            or on either end of a deadly hunt across a dense city or town. You
            might even find yourself holed up in an attic, listening for the
            slightest creak or scape to indicate a nearby presence, shotgun in
            hand. The use of sound to build tension and alert you to nearby
            enemies is one of the ways PUBG forces you to stay attentive and
            tactical rather than treating every round like a fast-paced shooter
            à la Call of Duty or Battlefield. Play long enough, and you can
            learn the subtleties that tip off when another player has been in a
            place before you — an open door or an unusually dense or sparse pile
            of mismatched loot are telltale signs you should watch your back.
            All these layers merge to build a shooter that’s invested in
            creating smart, nuanced survival and understands how even the
            smallest moments of your story build up to create the larger
            adventure.

            The entire dynamic of both exploration and combat changes
            drastically by grouping up in the pre-game lobby. Playing solo
            brings certain elements to the formula that going in with a partner
            doesn’t, and the same goes for trios and four-player squads. There
            might be more freedom and greater opportunity for stealth in going
            alone, but a well-coordinated team has more potential for pulling
            off exciting ambushes and vehicular assaults – and they’re much more
            survivable because you can revive a teammate who’s been knocked down
            but not finished off. Playing in first-person-only servers also
            brings a new, challenging dimension to matches by eliminating the
            corner-peaking advantages granted by the default third-person
            camera.
            <br /><br />
            The gunplay itself is also great. Firearms feel good to shoot and
            there’s a good range of options for all playstyles. And while PUBG
            does retain that military-sim stiffness that’s become synonymous
            with the genre, it’s just smoothed out enough to keep combat and
            movement satisfying and accessible to newcomers. The new vaulting
            system (added as PUBG left Early Access) is a particularly handy
            addition, allowing you to climb over fences and through windows for
            easier getaways and sneakier shortcuts.
            <br /><br />
            Other than that, a couple handy hotkeys to cycle weapons, switch
            between third- or first-person perspective, toggle auto or burst
            fire for your gun, and adjust zeroing distance are most of what you
            need to know beyond the obvious. The simple and intuitive UI is also
            particularly refined, which makes looting bodies and swapping items
            with teammates as easy as a quick click and drag.
            <br />
            A number of quality-of-life features round out even PUBG’s roughest
            edges: being able to access your inventory and map while on the
            move, adjust the camera mid-stride without changing direction, and a
            generous leniency with fall damage stand out as some of the most
            valuable. Since the 1.0 launch, I haven’t experienced significant
            performance or rubberbanding issues, but it’s important to note that
            version 1.0 still hasn’t managed to eliminate the hacking problem
            that’s most prevalent in high-skill matchmaking games, or a handful
            of persistent bugs.
            <br /><br />
            <span>Verdict</span>
            PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay
            popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most
            exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds
            of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game
            starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new,
            tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for
            hours on end.
